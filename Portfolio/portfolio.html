          I'm currently studying for a B(hons.) in Computing from Coventry
          University at Softwarica College. My academic journey has been a mix
          of both theory and hands-on projects, giving me a solid grounding in
          software development, data analysis, and project management.
          Throughout my studies, I've had the chance to work with various
          technologies, such as Python for data visualization, MySQL Workbench
          for SQL queries, Visual Paradigm for ER diagrams, and Excel for data
          normalization. I'm passionate about creating efficient, user-centered
          solutions, and I'm always eager to learn new skills and adapt to
          different challenges. Beyond my technical skills, I've also had the
          opportunity to lead projects using agile methodologies. As the Scrum
          Master for the LED project, I honed my abilities in teamwork, task
          organization, and team management, which has been a valuable
          experience in my development.
